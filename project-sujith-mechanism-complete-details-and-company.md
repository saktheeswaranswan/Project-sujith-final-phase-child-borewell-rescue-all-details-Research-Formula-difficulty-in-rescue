| No. | Difficulty | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | **Encountering Water Table** | When rescuers reach depths where water starts to flow, the risk of drowning increases significantly. |
| 2 | **Submerged Victim Positioning** | Victims are submerged in water, which can limit visibility and access. |
| 3 | **Rapid Water Inflow** | Water rising suddenly into the borewell can trap victims instantly and unexpectedly. |
| 4 | **Water Pressure Impact** | High groundwater pressure compresses bodies, making extraction difficult. |
| 5 | **Unstable Soil Collapse** | Water flow destabilizes soil, which can collapse into the borewell unexpectedly. |
| 6 | **Accumulated Sludge and Debris** | Sludge and dirt near the water table can form blockages, trapping the victim tightly. |
| 7 | **Weak Borewell Walls** | Water erosion compromises borewell walls, which can collapse during extraction efforts. |
| 8 | **Difficulty in Pumping Water Out** | Submersible pumps may fail if they get damaged by debris or water pressure. |
| 9 | **Suction Device Ineffectiveness** | Devices meant to pull victims upward fail due to water-filled borewalls. |
| 10 | **Oxygen Supply Depletion** | Water-filled borewells reduce oxygen availability, posing asphyxiation risks. |
| 11 | **Risk of Drowning During Extraction** | Victims risk drowning during any movement caused by extraction machinery. |
| 12 | **Water Evacuation Logistics** | Removing water takes time and requires specialized tools that may fail or malfunction. |
| 13 | **Counter Bore Instability** | Nearby counter bores contribute to instability, flooding the main borewell unexpectedly. |
| 14 | **Debris Blocking Vertical Access** | Rocks, soil, and debris accumulate, making a straight-line extraction difficult. |
| 15 | **Difficulty in Stabilizing Equipment** | Submersible and extraction tools become less reliable under fluctuating water pressure. |
| 16 | **Groundwater Interaction Hazards** | Changes in groundwater flow patterns during extraction efforts can worsen trapping risks. |
| 17 | **Survival Time Constraints** | Victims have limited survival time due to oxygen depletion and hypothermia risks. |
| 18 | **Pumps Overheating in Continuous Operation** | Continuous use of pumps increases the risk of equipment failure. |
| 19 | **Complex Layered Water Table Zones** | Uneven groundwater layers complicating extraction logistics and stability. |
| 20 | **Hydraulic Pressure Variations** | Pressure differentials cause sudden shifts in soil stability and borewell collapse. |
| 21 | **Debris-Loaded Water Layers** | Layers filled with stones and mud create blockages that extraction tools cannot bypass. |
| 22 | **Soil Saturation Impact** | Water-saturated soil leads to significant instability during any rescue maneuver. |
| 23 | **Nearby Bore Stability Risk** | Borewells in proximity collapse due to water interactions and ground pressure. |
| 24 | **Lack of Visibility Under Water** | Difficulty in camera and sensor deployment to monitor victim positioning underwater. |
| 25 | **Manual Extraction Ineffectiveness** | Reliance on manual methods becomes slow and inefficient under water layers. |
| 26 | **Sudden Ground Movement** | Ground shifts unexpectedly due to changing water pressure and soil interactions. |
| 27 | **Rescue Tool Submersion Failure** | Submersible tools often fail due to prolonged exposure to water and debris. |
| 28 | **Clogging of Suction Pipes** | Suction pipes get clogged with mud and debris, compromising extraction tools. |
| 29 | **Inadequate Pumping Speed** | Slow pumping efforts result in prolonged exposure to hazardous water levels. |
| 30 | **Fluctuating Groundwater Levels** | Groundwater levels rise and fall dynamically, destabilizing rescue operations. |
| 31 | **Child Size and Narrow Access** | Small body size complicates the maneuverability and extraction through narrow borewalls. |
| 32 | **Breathing Challenges Under Water** | Oxygen limitations make survival difficult as drowning risks increase. |
| 33 | **Multiple Bore Collapse Risk** | Nearby borewells collapsing simultaneously due to unstable ground interactions. |
| 34 | **Obstruction from Vertical Rocks** | Large rocks prevent vertical extraction, requiring more complex rescue operations. |
| 35 | **Mechanical Wear of Equipment** | Continuous operation and interaction with debris wear out pumps and machines. |
| 36 | **Risk of Sudden Cave-In** | Borewell walls collapsing unexpectedly due to shifting soil pressures. |
| 37 | **Limited Insertion of Protective Shields** | Shields and safety barriers often fail in water-heavy environments. |
| 38 | **Asphyxiation Risk due to Oxygen Shortage** | Water layers limit fresh air supply, increasing asphyxiation risks. |
| 39 | **Vertical Entry Angle Issues** | Difficult angles of entry reduce the effectiveness of extraction tools. |
| 40 | **Constant Monitoring Challenges** | Continuous changes in water levels require real-time monitoring and adjustments. |
